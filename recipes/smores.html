    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A s'more is a treat that consists of two graham cracker pieces with chocolate and toasted marshmallow in between. Popular in both the US and Canada, s'mores are often made over a campfire. 
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 sheets graham crackers</li>
        <li>1 4.4oz bar milk chocolate, such as Hershey's, broken into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
        <li>8pcs large marshmallows</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turn the grill's heat down to medium. (Heat from a gas barbecue cooling down or from a dying charcoal grill will also work nicely.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut each sheet of Graham Crackers in half lengthwise, forming two squares. Place a square of graham cracker on a piece of foil, top with a bit of chocolate and a sprinkling of kosher salt, working with one or two s'mores at a time. Set over the edge of the grill for about 30 seconds, or just until the chocolate is softened and warmed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring the chocolate and graham cracker squares to the grill. The marshmallows will soften and fall off the skewer as they toast. Skewer marshmallows on a long fork or metal skewer, a few at a time, and hold them over the fire approximately 2 inches above the grates. Toast for one to two minutes, tossing occasionally, or until the marshmallow puffs up and turns golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using the square of graham with the chocolate and a plain graham square, place the marshallow on the chocolate and, using the plain graham, squish the marshmallow down and pull off the skewer. Eat while it is warm and gooey and perfect.
