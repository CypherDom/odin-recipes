    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12pcs 8-inch square spring roll wrappers </li>
      <li>5oz light brown sugar</li>
      <li>6pcs Saba bananas</li>
      <li>2pcs ripe jackfruit in syrup</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil or other neutral oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour the water into a small basin and the brown sugar into a medium-sized shallow bowl. Place one spring roll wrapper with the point facing you on a work area, like a diamond.
    </li>
      <li>
        Coat one slice of banana on all sides by tossing it in sugar. Place the horizontally positioned banana slice covered in sugar in the middle of the wrapper. If using, place two slices of jackfruit on top.
    </li>
      <li>
        Fold the wrapper over the banana, tucking the point below, starting with the point nearest to you. The wrapper's right and left points should be folded over the banana like an envelope; they will slightly overlap. Roll the banana tightly away from you, exposing the top point for about 2 inches. Wet the tip of your finger with water by dipping it in, then roll to seal. Continue with the leftover wrappers and banana slices; before frying, roll the turon and don't let it set for longer than an hour. Set aside any leftover brown sugar (you should have about 4 ounces, or 115g).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a wire rack inside a baking sheet with a rim. Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat to 350°F (177°C). Half of the turon rolls should be added to the oil in a single layer using tongs. Fry the turon for about three minutes, turning it occasionally, or until it's golden brown all over. Adjust the heat as necessary to get the temperature back up to and then stay at 350°F (177°C). Place the turon on the ready-made wire rack. After bringing the oil down to 350°F (177°C), repeat with the last turon.  
      </li>
      <li>
        To raise the oil's temperature to 375°F (190°C), adjust the heat. Using tongs, evenly distribute the reserved brown sugar into the oil; it will melt and become slightly darker in color. Using the tongs, swiftly return the turon to the skillet, moving them around and flipping them once halfway through, until the turon are completely covered in caramel, which should take approximately a minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the turon to the wire rack with tongs, and allow it to cool for about three minutes, or until the caramel has solidified. Serve right away.
